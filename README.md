Hey and welcome/Bienvenue(I really love French...lol) to my GitHub profile! My name is Arasanyin Adedamola(Dancho) and I am a Front End web developer and aspiring to be so much more.

Software development is a passion that I have strangely but passionately grown accustomed to since my late teen years, I have gained a substantial amount of knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React and I am very enthusiastic about contributing and learning from this community of developers on GitHub as a whole.

In my projects displayed here, you'll find a scope of web applications that display my skills and interests in web devlopment. I hope to one day become a Full stack developer and I am continually driving myself towards growing, learning and creating new things in order to achieve that goal.

If you have any questions or just want to talk about Software development do not hesitate to reach out to me! I'm always available and happy to connect with other developers of like mind.
